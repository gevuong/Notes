### Rails Routes to test API on (https://art-sharing-api.herokuapp.com/) used postgresql db

user_artworks

       GET    /users/:user_id/artworks(.:format) artworks#index

 users

       GET    /users                  users#index
       GET    /users/:id              users#show
artworks

       GET    /artworks/:id          artworks#show

artwork_shares

       GET    /artwork_shares         artwork_shares#index

comments

       GET    /comments               comments#index


## Art Share API

Our goal is to build an application to store, share, and
comment on artwork, as well as search for users.

Each user has a set of artworks that they own/control. These artworks can also be shared with other users. An artwork that has been shared with one or more other users will be visible to those users, but the artwork still 'belongs to' the original user.

Although we will maintain this conceptual distinction between a user's own artworks vs. the artworks that have been shared with that user, we will eventually write an index method that will combine both types of a user's viewable artworks together so that we can see any art made by or shared with that user.


## Learning Goals

* Be able to write Active Record models quickly
* Know how to write a `user_params` method
* Be able to write the five API RESTful controller methods
* Know how to test your API endpoints with Postman
* Know how to create and destroy join table records via controller
methods
* Know how a nested route works


### Trivia Notes

open postgres
rails new project_name --database=postgresql
bundle install
rails g migration createArtworkShare
rails db:create
be rails routes

**When a client makes an HTTP request, the webserver receives it and hands it off to Rails. The Rails router looks up the controller action to call. As mentioned, it creates an instance of the controller to handle the response. The router then calls the appropriate method on the controller instance.**

The controller instance then takes over the request processing. It runs the given method. As part of its work in the method, it should render a response or issue a redirect.

After issuing the response, the request is over and the connection between client-and-server is closed. The controller instance is discarded.
* A resource is anything in your application that you will be CRUDing.

* A RESTful resource can either be a collection of objects or a single instance. These collections/instance have access to CRUD actions dictated by HTTP methods.

* The idea that in REST is that URLs refer to either collections of resources (i.e. collection of user objects) or a single instance of resources. The different HTTP methods specify the limited number of things you can do to a collection/instance (create, read, update, destroy).

* The REST philosophy is that even more complicated actions, like "liking a photo", should be thought of in terms of CRUD (create/read/update/destroy) actions on resources. For instance, instead of creating a custom, non-RESTful controller action to "like" a photo, we might create a new resource, a Like object, which we could either create/destroy in the normal way.

* Applications, and especially web APIs, are all about connecting data in your database with the outside world.

* Browsers aren't the only program that can make HTTP requests. When a non-browser client makes an API request, the requestor probably prefers a raw representation of the data rather than an HTML document that includes a lot of extraneous formatting information and is difficult to parse. JSON is typically a better format for non-browser clients.

* The key to building a Rails API is to get your controllers to convert model objects into JSON, and then return the JSON. This requires support at two layers: the model layer (convert a model to JSON) and the controller layer (return the JSON to the user).

How data comes into our controllers from the outside world.

**#params is a method provided by ActionController::Base that returns a hash of all the parameters available. The parameters are complied by the router and are sourced from three places:

Route parameters (e.g. the :id from /users/:id)
Query string (the part of the URL after the ?: ?key=value)
POST/PATCH request data (the body of the HTTP request).
**
